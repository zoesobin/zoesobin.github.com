<h2>day 1</h2>
<article>Today my plane crashed on an island. I was flying with Will Clarkson.<br>
Actually he was flying the plane. ANYWAYS all that seem to be here are sloths.<br>
They are beautiful and perfect creatures. Tonight I will snuggle with them.<br>

<h2>day 2</h2>
<article>Today they sacrificed Will Clarkson. At first I was like OMGWTF but<br>
then I was like LOLOLOLOL. Then we ate Will Clarkson soup and hung from<br>
trees upside down.<br>
